
64 Sprites Moving demo.

This is a very heavy(slow) demo.
A game with 64 tasks cannot run at 60fps when written in C.
Processing fails in 7.1 MHz mode of the actual machine or emulator.

It Åfs a point of thought.
It's hard to make everything with assembler.

To maintain 60fps for the time being....
It seems that there is no choice but to reduce the number of tasks that appear.
